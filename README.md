# MachineLearningPCA-Logistic

This google document file is used to determine whether a headline will indicate if the article is from a fake or real website. I have previously conducted similar classification tests using the naive bayes and K-Nearest Neighbour approach. In this document I have determined whether an article is real or fake by using the logistic regression algorithm. Furthermore, we will be using the Logistic regression algorithm in combination with:

--Item With an L1 penalty
--Item With an L2 Penalty 
-With no Penalty 
-100-Principal Component analysis reduction 
-1000-Principal Component analysis reduction 
Cross Validation with:
-L1 Penalty 
-L2 Penalty 
-No Penalty
The F1, Precision, and Recall scores are shown on all tests above.
