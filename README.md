The PCa-Logistic Regression google document file is used to determine whether a headline will indicate if the 
        article is from a fake or real website. I have previously conducted similar classification tests using the Naive Bayes and K-Nearest
        Neighbour approach. In this document I have determined whether an article is real or fake by using the logistic regression algorithm.
        Furthermore, we will be using the Logistic regression algorithm in combination with:

             an L1 Penalty </li>

            an L2 Penalty</li>
            no Penalty</li>
            a 100-Principal Component analysis reduction   </li>
            a 100-Principal Component analysis reduction  </li>
             Cross Validation with:
                     an L1 Penalty </li>
                     an L2 Penalty</li>
                    no Penalty</li>

      
The F1, Precision, and Recall scores are shown on all tests above.
